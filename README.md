# Java-Assignment
This is a platformaing game made in java from scratch without a game engine.  
The game starts immidiately, arrows and w,a,s,d can be used to move.  
Some of the systems made are physics, collision detection, animation and spritesheet cropping.  

![demo](https://github.com/Marcin7373/Java-Assignment/blob/master/gfx/img/demo.PNG?raw=true)

It uses two sprite sheets which are in the "img" folder. 
The game assumes the java build path for "img" was added. If the path to the images is different it can be changed in the /gfx/SpriteCrop class by changing the two paths at the top of init.
