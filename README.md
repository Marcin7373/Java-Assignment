# Java-Assignment
For my java assignment i made a platforming game.
The game starts immidiately, arrows and w,a,s,d can be used to move.

It uses two sprite sheets which are in the "img" folder. 
The game assumes the java build path for "img" was added.
If the path to the images is different it can be changed in the SpriteCrop class
by changing just the two paths at the top of init.
